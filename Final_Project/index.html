					<h2>Open Source Intelligence</h2>

						<h4> INTellingence: Open Source Intelligence</h4>

<p>The president and policymakers rely on insights from the Central Intelligence Agency to inform their foreign policy decisions. CIA officers use a variety of sources in formulating their assessments. The following article is the first in a series that will explore different sources and collection disciplines, which are the building blocks of what we call “finished intelligence.” This article will focus on open source intelligence.</p>
<br>


<br>
<p>Information does not have to be secret to be valuable. Whether in the blogs we browse, the broadcasts we watch, or the specialized journals we read, there is an endless supply of information that contributes to our understanding of the world. The Intelligence Community generally refers to this information as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). OSINT plays an essential role in giving the national security community as a whole insight and context at a relatively low cost.</p>

<h5>OSINT is drawn from publicly available material, including: </h5>
<ul>
	<li>The Internet</li>
	<li>Traditional mass media (e.g. television, radio, newspapers, magazines)</li>
	<li>Specialized journals, conference proceedings, and think tank studies</li>
	<li>Photos</li>
	<li>Geospatial information (e.g. maps and commercial imagery products)</li>
</ul>
